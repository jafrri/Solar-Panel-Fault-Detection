# Solar-Panel-Fault-Detection
This notebook demonstrates CNN-based fault detection for solar panels, focusing on identifying various faults such as physical damage, snow coverage, and dust accumulation. It uses the transfer learning from VGG16 and evaluates the model's performance using precision, recall, and accuracy metrics.
